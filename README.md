# Tetris2

## To do List
* Create logic for tetris on pygame
* At some point, create testing for our game that tests whenever a commit is made
* Implement feature: Add row to opponent when you clear yours. Instead of this, could decrease their score when you increase your own (by removing a row on your side)
* Possibly implement a feature which enables users to use a controller to control their pieces, instead of having both players use one keyboard
* Use tkinter and firebase to store user login data, and authenticate their account
* Other rules: Create branch off of main, and work off of it, merging when done. Meet 2-3 times a day, through Zoom
* Package pygame app and make it downloadable on some free Internet-Accessible hosting service. Possible options include: InfinityFree (has 5gb disk space), Google Cloud Hosting,...
